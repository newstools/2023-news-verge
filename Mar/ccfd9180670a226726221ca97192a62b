Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Nigeria’s 16th President-elect has promised to deliver on the yearnings of Nigerians for a new country. Tinubu defeated 17 other candidates who took part in the election. He scored a total of 8,794,726 votes, the highest of all the candidates, thus meeting the first constitutional requirement to be declared the winner. He also scored over 25 per cent of the votes cast in 30 states, more than the 25 states constitutionally required. Delivering his acceptance speech, the All Progressive Congress (APC) candidate said, “I am humbled to have been elected as the 16th president of Nigeria since the return to democracy. “I am the man to deliver on the hope of a new Nigeria”. Tinubu thanked supporters of Atiku and Obi for their hope for a new Nigeria and promised to deliver on the yearnings of Nigerians. He commended INEC for the fairness and credibility of the just concluded Presidential election. He however called on Atiku and other candidates to join him to build a united Nigeria. “Let us team up together, there is the only nation and country we have. “We must not act like that orchestra that does not have the direction of a conductor.” The road to victory for the former Governor of Lagos State was far from being smooth. To earn his party’s ticket for the race, he had to contend with heavyweights and party-men such as Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan and former Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, among others to win his party’s ticket. Frustrated with the seeming lack of support from the President and reported opposition by key members of the Presidency, he would go on to make his now famous “Emilokan (It is my turn)” speech on June 2, 2022. “It is the turn of Yoruba, it is my turn,” he said while addressing party delegates at the Presidential Lodge in Abeokuta, Ogun State.
