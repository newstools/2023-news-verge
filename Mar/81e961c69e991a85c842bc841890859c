The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), in Ogun, has advised motorists to ensure that their vehicles are roadworthy, to minimise accidents as the rainy season sets in. Mr Iyanda Taofiq, Sagamu Unit Commander, gave the advice in an interview with our reporter on Friday, in Sagamu. Taofiq said that the advice had become necessary to reduce mishaps during the approaching rainy season. He said that, as part of routine to ensure that their vehicles were roadworthy, motorists should examine their lighting systems, wipers, brake systems, as well as their tyres. “They should check their tyres because a worn-out tyre can serve them during the dry season, but during rainy season, if they apply brake, it could affect their vehicles, causing road crashes which sometimes result to unnecessary loss of lives,” he said. Taofiq warned the motorists against excessive speed and reckless driving, to prevent avoidable crashes.
