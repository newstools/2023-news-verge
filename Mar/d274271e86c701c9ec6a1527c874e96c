Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia has said that the peace and security of Abia are more important to him than his senatorial bid. Ikpeazu said this in a press statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Onyebuchi Ememanka and made available to newsmen on Wednesday in Umuahia. The governor said: “Our government is resolutely committed to ensuring continuing security and peace that Abia has consistently enjoyed under my watch. “We are grateful to God that so far there is no single account of any loss of life during the presidential and National Assembly elections. There were also no reports of electoral violence. “On a personal note, I am a fulfilled man. I have won many battles and elections, including defeating Covid-19. “Elections will come and go every four years and just like in any other contest, you win some and lose some.” Ikpeazu added that the state government was resolute in ensuring that the peace and security which defined the last elections would be replicated in the gubernatorial and state House of Assembly polls. He said that the events that followed the presidential and National Assembly elections would not deter the Peoples Democratic Party in Abia from working towards successfully delivering all her candidates on March 11. Ikpeazu called on the people of Abia to remain calm, peaceful and law abiding as the state prepared for the March 11 polls.
