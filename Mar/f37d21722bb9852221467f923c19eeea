The Spokesperson of ‘Generation Next Campaign Council’, Mr Shittu Bamayi has that the no governorship candidate in Plateau can match the credentials of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Nentawe Yilwatda. Bamayi in statement on Monday in Jos, said that Yilwatda’s pedigree, intellect, exposure and foresight for a better Plateau stands him out. The spokesman stated that it was an open fact that Yilwatda was adjudged about forty  years ago as the second best ICT engineer in the country and has maintained the high standard. He added the APC governorship candidate meritoriously became a consultant with the  United Nations, UNICEF and the African Union in software application. “Yilwatda made an indelible mark in  INEC as a result of his unequalled expertise in drawing and managing the ICT system in the organisation. “It is therefore not surprising that private organizations and some state governments across the country have consulted him for expert advice on ICT,” he said. ”It is wicked, laughable and rather unfortunate and myopic that the opposition parties can condescend so low in making toxic allegations just to poison the minds of the unsuspecting electorate,” he said. ”Rather than being adversarial, the APC campaign council considers the party’s governorship primary as a non issue and will therefore not be distracted, moreso  when it is coming from the opposition,” he said.
