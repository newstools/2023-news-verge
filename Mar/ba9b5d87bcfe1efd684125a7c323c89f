A Grade I Area Court in Kubwa, Abuja, has dissolved a 12-year-old marriage between a housewife, Amina Hamisu and her estranged husband, Ibrahim Isyaku over desertion. The Judge, Malam Yahaya Sheshi, dissolved the marriage according to Islamic Law, following Hamisu’s prayer for divorce on grounds of abandonment. Sheshi added that considering the evidence given by the two witnesses, Mustapha Abdulrasheed and Hadiza Garba, it was eminent that the respondent neglected and starved the petitioner and their three children. He ordered Hamisu to observe “Iddah” (waiting period) of three months according to Islamic injunction, before contracting another marriage. Earlier, the petitioner had told the court that the respondent does not provide food, shelter,clothing and medication for the family. While giving evidence, the petitioner’s brother-in-law, Abdulrasheed said that the respondent abandoned his wife and children without care in the village, in Kano and her family asked her to join him in Abuja. “In spite of Hamisu relocating, her husband did not change. The family asked her to return to her sister’s house so that he can change but he did not,” he said. Abdulrasheed added that the respondent disrespects his wife’s parents and begged the court to dissolve the marriage since the husband was no longer interested. The respondent however denied the allegations against him.
