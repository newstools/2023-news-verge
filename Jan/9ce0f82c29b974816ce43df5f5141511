A Makurdi Chief Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday, ordered that a 40-year-old housewife, Charity Upev and her son, Tertsea be remanded in a correction centre for alleged culpable homicide. The police charged Upev and her son, who live in Makurdi, Benue with criminal conspiracy and culpable homicide.
However, Magistrate Roseline Iyorshe, did not take their plea for want in jurisdiction. Iyorshe adjourned the matter until Feb. 8, for further mention and transferred the case file. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Insp Jonah Uletu had told the court that on Jan 24, the DPO of ‘E’ Division Police Station, Makurdi received information that Upev and her son beat up Fanen, her in-law living with her. The prosecutor said Upev claimed that her in-law stole meat from her pot of soup. The police said Fanen became unconscious as a result of the beating and was rushed to the hospital, but died while receiving treatment. The offence, the prosecutor said, contravenes the provisions of sections of 97 and 222 of the Penal Code laws of Benue, 2004.
