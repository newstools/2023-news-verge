The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila has congratulated the APC candidate in the Osun governorship election, Mr Oyetola Adegboyega on his victory at the election tribunal. Mr Lanre Lasisi, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the speaker, in a statement in Abuja on Saturday, said the tribunal verdict was a welcome development. Gbajabiamila said it was a fair deal for the people of Osun who stood by Oyetola to ensure his reelection in the July 2022 governorship election. The speaker noted that with the judgment, the APC remained the party to beat at all times, especially during the forthcoming general elections. He said the people of Osun  had been vindicated by the verdict, while  calling on APC members in Osun and across the country to remain law-abiding and brace up for the general elections. He commended the Osun governorship election tribunal, adding that it was convinced that there were anomalies during the election, which was why it restored the peopleâ€™s mandate. The speaker urged Oyetola to be magnanimous in victory at the end of the whole process.
