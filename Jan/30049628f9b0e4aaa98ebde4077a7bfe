The world’s oldest known person, French nun Sister André, has died at age 118 in the southern French city of Toulon, the city’s mayor Hubert Falco said on Wednesday. Born in the southern French town of Ales on Feb. 11, 1904, as Lucile Randon, Sister André was listed as the oldest person alive by the Gerontology Research Group in April 2022. The Frenchwoman worked as a home teacher in her youth and did not enter a religious community until she was in her early 40s. Most recently, Sister André was confined to a wheelchair, and for several years she could no longer see properly. She was an honorary citizen of Toulon, where she lived in a retirement home for several years. Falco praised her as incredibly modern and a nun with a big heart. Guinness World Records said Lucile, who took the name of Sister André in 1944, was the second-oldest French person and the second-oldest European person ever recorded. More recently, Sister André received the record for the oldest COVID-19 survivor after an infection in 2021. “It’s difficult to fathom that someone born before the patenting of plastic, zips or even bras were alive well into the 21st century, and robust enough to beat COVID-19.” The Guinness World Records editor, Craig Glenday said in a statement. “It’s been an honour to record her story in the pages of the Guinness World Records book, and she will live on in history as the fourth oldest person ever authenticated.” With her death, Maria Branyas Morera, who lived in Spain, assumed the title of the world’s oldest person at age 115.
