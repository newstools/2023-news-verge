Unilorin, on Tuesday, said the institution want timely completion of the bridge and the provision of more strategic interventions to ease traffic flow. He expressed the institution’s deep concern about the enormity of the transportation challenges currently being faced by students. “We want to assure all that measures are being put in place to ease this difficulty in the shortest possible time. “The management is also considering the possibility of reviving the virtual lecture option, especially for large classes, to reduce the necessity of having large number of students on the road at peak periods. “Arrangements had already been concluded to bring in big buses for massive movement of students but they could not be deployed yet due to the Flyover construction on the University Road,” he explained. Akogun however appealed to students to exercise patience while concerted efforts are being made to resolve the unfortunate transportation challenge. “The welfare of our students remain the mainstay of the Management and this will not be compromised for any reason,” he assured
