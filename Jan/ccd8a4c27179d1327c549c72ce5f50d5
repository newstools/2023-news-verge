Leeds United eased into the 2022/2023 English FA Cup fifth round on Saturday after a stunner from Jack Harrison helped see off Accrington with a 3-1 away win. Harrison blasted the English Premier League side in front from distance midway through the first half against the third-tier strugglers. Thereafter, a first Leeds United goal for Junior Firpo and another from Luis Sinisterra helped ease some of the pressure on manager Jesse Marsch. Substitute Leslie Adekoya scored with his first touch late on to earn John Colemanâ€™s team a consolation. Earlier, Sinisterra had been denied when his drive was brilliantly tipped onto a post by Accrington goalkeeper Toby Savin. The visitors survived a scare when Harvey Rodgers skied over the bar from six yards with the score at 1-0. Leicester City made heavy weather of their trip to play fourth tier Walsall. Kelechi Iheanacho scored the only goal with a deflected strike in the second half, after Youri Tielemans had struck a post from the penalty kick spot.
