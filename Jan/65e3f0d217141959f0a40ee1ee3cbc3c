The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) today extended the deadline for the use of the old notes till February 10. CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, announced the extension in a statement signed on Sunday. He explained that the apex bank has sought approval from President Muhammadu Buhari to extend the deadline for the use of the old notes by 10 days. “Based on the foregoing, we have sought and obtained Mr President’s approval for the following:  A 10-day extension of the deadline from January 31 to February 10 to allow for the collection of more old notes legitimately held by Nigerians,” the statement read. “A 7-day grace period, beginning from February 10 to February 17, in compliance with Sections 20(3) and 22 of the CBN Act allowing Nigerians to deposit their old notes at the CBN after the February deadline when the old currency would have lost its Legal Tender Status.” The CBN Governor also solicited the cooperation of all Nigerians in ensuring a hitch-free process for the implementation of the policy. Before the apex bank extended the use of the naira note, many Nigerians experienced difficulty in lodging their old banknotes. The scramble by many Nigerians to meet the initial January 31 deadline has been chaotic as many of them flood banking halls with huge cash in old notes to exchange them with new ones. Others are seen in long queues at the few ATM points having the new naira notes in different parts of the country to have access. The naira redesign was greeted by criticism by some Nigerians, including the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), saying the policy was intended to scuttle his presidential ambition.
