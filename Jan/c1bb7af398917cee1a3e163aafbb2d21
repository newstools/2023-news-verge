The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Oyo State has announced the devolution of collection of Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVCs) to 351 registration areas/ward collation centres across the state. This is contained in a statement on Friday in Ibadan, by the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Dr Adeniran Tella. The devolution which would start on Jan. 15, from  9:00 am to 3:00 pm daily, would bring PVCs collection nearer to the people ahead of preparations toward the forthcoming general elections in the state. The REC further explained that the exercise was for all eligible valid registrant, “those that applied for replacement of lost, damaged or defaced PVCs. “And those that registered prior to the 2019 general elections and are yet to collect their cards.” Tella stressed that collection of PVCs would revert to all the 33 INEC Local Government Area Offices until Jan 22. He implored the electorate to make good use of the exercise as collection would not be by proxy.
