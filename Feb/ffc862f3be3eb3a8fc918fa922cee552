The Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) has announced the suspension of its campaign activities ahead of the forthcoming elections due to fuel scarcity and cash crunch occasioned by the Naira redesign. The state Chairman of the party, Pastor Cornelius Ojelabi, made the announcement in a statement by the party’s Publicity Secretary, Mr Seye Oladejo, on Tuesday. Ojelabi said the decision was reached due to the scarcity of fuel and pain caused by the Naira redesign. The chairman said that the party empathised with the general public, especially the downtrodden who were at the receiving end. According to him, it will be insensitive to forge ahead with the various rallies with the situation of things. Ojelabi said that members of APC were not immuned against the development, adding that he had been inundated with several complaints. “I joined my voice with those of other well-meaning Nigerians to call for the review of the Naira redesign policy to give it a human face and ameliorate the suffering of ordinary Nigerians,” he said. The chairman appealed that petroleum products should be made available in order not to jeopardise the preparation for the elections and reduce the negative economic impact. He enjoined all Lagos residents to remain law abiding as all issues would be resolved in due course. Our correspondent reports that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Oct. 26, 2022, announced the introduction of redesigned N200, N500 and N1,000 notes into the financial system. The scarcity of the new notes and fuel scarcity has continued to disrupt business activities across Nigeria.
