The agents including APC and PDP refused to accept the announcement of results unless their complaints were addressed. Speaking to journalists, the PDP agent, Mr Aderemi Adeshina, claimed that some voters were disenfranchised in some polling units in the LGA. Adeshina, also claimed that results recorded in some units after the elections were not transmitted through the BVAS machine. “We will not accept the result until another election takes place in all the wards where we were disenfranchised”, he said. NAN reports that security agents including the police and army were on the ground to ensure and maintain safety and peace.
