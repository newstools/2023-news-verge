Gov. Mai Mala Buni of Yobe on Thursday performed ground-breaking ceremony of N3.8 billion Geidam ultra modern market in Geidam Local Government Area of the state. He said that the contract awarded to Green and Blue Communication and Electronics Limited was expected to be completed within 12 months. “I am optimistic that the strategic position of Geidam, sharing an international border with Niger Republic, the market will promote commerce. “It will also provide job opportunities, improve the local economy and increase our internally generated revenue,” he said. He attributed the delay in the construction of the Geidam market to the challenges posed by the insurgency. The governor tasked the local government council and traditional rulers to cooperate with the contractor to facilitate timely completion of the project. Buni also inaugurated a Mega school, two primary healthcare centres and two-kilometre township road in Geidam. He directed the Ministry of Works and the state Road Maintenance Agency to rehabilitate Geidam – Mainisorowa and Garin Gada – Geidam-Bukarti road.
