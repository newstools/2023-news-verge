An Italian betting syndicate of 90 punters has come up with the six correct numbers to secure a record win of more than 371 million euros (395 million dollars). The highest jackpot yet distributed in a lottery draw in Europe. The Superenalotto draw was held on Thursday evening. The winners, who individually put up a stake of five euros and have not been identified,would receive more than 4 million euros each. While Spain’s Christmas season “El Gordo” distributes more than 2 billion euros, it is not a jackpot that rises with each round without a winner. In addition, the winnings were distributed to a large number of punters. Italy’s Superenalotto required punters to select six numbers in a field from 1 to 90. There had been no winner since May 2021 almost 21 months. The winnings went to punters in 16 of Italy’s 20 regions. The jackpot world record was won in November last year when a punter in California won a Powerball draw for 2.04 billion dollars.
