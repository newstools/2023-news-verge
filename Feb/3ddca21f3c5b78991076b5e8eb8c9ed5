Bayern Munich full-back Noussair Mazraoui returned to team training on Thursday from a heart problem that has sidelined him since the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the Bundesliga champions have said. The 25-year-old Mazraoui contracted the coronavirus at the World Cup where his Moroccan team reached the semi-finals, and the illness was followed by a mild inflammation of the heart sac. The health problem has made him miss all training and games since the German league restarted in January. Returning to team training is seen as final step towards a full return. Leaders Bayern Munich are tied at the top of the 2022/2023 Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund and Union Berlin, and host Union on Sunday. The champions are coming off a 3-2 defeat at Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach.
