He said he would govern without sentiments if elected, adding that he had  enough experience haven travelled across the country and beyond. “I have seen a lot about government, and journalism has given me an insight into governance, I want to graduate the state from where it is now, to a higher place. “I am well equipped and very prepared, I have risen to speak in favour of the masses, even in the house. “I’m not a man of sentiments, I deal with people based on their content and what they have to offer. I have the courage to lead and fight for the survival of the people,” Adeyemi said. He decried nepotism in government, saying responsibilities should be given to people based on competences.
