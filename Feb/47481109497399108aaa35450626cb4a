He added that the directorate was led by serious and accomplished Nigerians who would never be insensitive to the plight of compatriots battling naira scarcity to brand wines as campaign souvenirs. “This is the most ludicrous campaign gimmick; we are not aware of this no-brainer kindergarten stunt, and should not be associated with such crass. “This is insulting to thousands and millions of Nigerians battling with the scarcity of fuel and cash. ”The directorate is not part of this tragicomedy, this is opposition propaganda to misinform Nigerians. `We call on our supporters and well-meaning Nigerians who believe in the renewed hope agenda of Sen.
