Our men are everywhere here in Kogi. They are strategically placed with Eagle eye to monitor politicians, INEC officials and other stakeholders. ”I want the people of Kogi to know that it is not going to be business as usual. “We are out to ensure that three is any iota of vote buying or vote selling here in Kogi. “The election has to be free and fair. We are going to work with other security agencies to stop such acts, ” he said. He advised the electorate not  to allow anybody lure them into selling his or her vote because both would face the same sanction as spelt out in the Electoral Act. He described the synergy between the 17 security operatives operating in the state as “apt” and “very encouraging” in tackling security matters in Kogi.
