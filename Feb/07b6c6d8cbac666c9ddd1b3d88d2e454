The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has called on communities in Lagos State to accept and offer necessary assistance to corps members posted to them to enable them serve them and the country effectively. Mrs Yetunde Baderinwa,the State NYSC Coordinator, made the call in an interview with our reporter on Wednesday in Lagos, Baderinwa said that the NYSC had prioritised grassroots, health and education sectors in the deployment of corps members after the mandatory three-week orientation course. According to her, the NYSC believes that the grassroots, education and health sectors are areas where corps members are most needed and can better impact the society. “We expect communities where our corps members are posted to embrace them and see them as their own. “They should support them in any way they can, irrespective of tribal or religious differences. “They need all encouragement to feel at home and have a sense of belonging to spur them to be committed and deliver services better in their host communities,” she said On deployment of corps members, the coordinator said NYSC could deploy corps members based on requests by organisations. According to her, letters of requests from such organisations are usually verified by NYSC before postings are made. “We receive letters from some organisations requesting corps members, as the case may be. “We verify the request letters and inform them(organisations) to pay them monthly stipends before posting,” she said. Baderinwa noted that a number of organisations had been working with the scheme in ensuring that corps members discharge their duties during the service year,commending them for their efforts.
